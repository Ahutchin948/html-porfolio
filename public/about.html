<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is A'zavier Hutchinson. I'm a highly motivated individual who has the heart for learning. 
  A little bit about myself: I'm 28 years Old, I live in Lincoln, Nebraska. I graduated from Lincoln North Star High School in 2014
  and I joined the US Army in 2013 and my Job was a 92G(Food Service Specialist). The Army taught me many things about
  Discipline, Teamwork, Motivation and not making excuses when something gets difficult. I was Honorably Discharged in 2021 after 8 Years of Service.
  But I still carry these values with me all of the years are they are very important to my character.</p>
  
<p> One thing that has really motivated me has been learning how to Code. I've been learning for the past few months.
  My instructor was Angela Yu. If you don't know who she is, she is a self taught 
  programmer who has taught over 1 million students worldwide both in person and online combined! I fully credit my 
  knowledge to her as her lessons were the best I've ever had. Honestly I had no idea what 
  I wanted to do in my life but I knew I needed a change in direction as I've been mostly working in Factories to make ends meet. 
  But my Girlfriend thought the idea of learning how to code might be a good option for me to try out and it turns out, it's actually pretty fun
  to learn.</p>

<p>What I would love to do with my coding skills is hopefully be able to land a great job that now only helps me continue to learn
  even more coding skills but to be able to use my knowledge to help and inspire more young people who want to learn a new skill
  as that would be pretty rewarding to be able to do. </p>


<p>Thank you for taking the time to read</p>
